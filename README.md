# test-trainer
Simple (only FE) app for learning for close-ended questions tests. Questions and answers are hardcoded (simplicity, 'member?).  
App was made for Polish State Fire Service, therefore it includes logo and some tests written in polish. Feel free to fork this repo and use it for different tests in different language.
