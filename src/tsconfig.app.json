// WARNING! Settings 'paths' is very tricky. VSCode reads only 'tsconfig.json', where angular compilator, typescript, webpack
// etc read also 'tsconfig.app.json'. To avoid error underline in VSCode, you should specify your paths in 'tsconfig.app'
// then copy them here and add '../' at the beggining of paths. This will fix error underline and you will avoid differences
// between VSCode and webpack, compilator, typescript. If you don't do that, you will suffer error underline in VSCode or
// errors in compilator. Do it wisely.
